# Supermarket Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a business intelligence dashboard created to provide a comprehensive overview of supermarket sales data. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights on sales trends, profitability, and customer behavior to support strategic decision-making.

## Problem Statement

A major supermarket chain requires a dynamic, interactive dashboard to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify opportunities to optimize product offerings and marketing strategies. The analysis focuses on answering critical business questions such as:

- What are the overall sales and profit trends?
- Which product lines are the most profitable?
- What are the key customer demographics?

## Tools Used

- **Power BI:** For data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design.
- **Power Query:** For data cleaning and transformation (ETL).
- **DAX:** For creating key business metrics and advanced calculations.

## Key Findings & Insights

Based on the analysis, the following key insights were uncovered:

- The overall profit margin for the business is approximately **4.8%**, indicating a healthy, but potentially improvable, financial performance.
- The **Home and Lifestyle** product line is the most profitable, while **Electronic Accessories** is the least profitable. This suggests opportunities for targeted promotions or inventory management.
- The majority of the customer base is **male (61.5%)**, which provides a clear target for future marketing campaigns.
